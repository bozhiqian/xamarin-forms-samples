Todo List Application
=====================

This sample relates to the [Working with a Local Database](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/working-with/databases/) but I rewrite with prism libary with appropriate updates to remove all code behind into view model. I removed all UI element written in code behind and replicate them in XAML.

Todo
====

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored and accessed in a local SQLite database.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add a new item to the list of tasks.
- Set a task's status to 'completed'.

In all cases the tasks are stored in a local SQLite database.

For more information about the sample see [Working with a Local Database](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/working-with/databases/).

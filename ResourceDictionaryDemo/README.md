Resource Dictionaries
=====================

This sample relates to the [Resource Dictionaries](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/resource-dictionaries/) but I rewrite with prism libary with appropriate updates to remove all code behind into view model. I removed all UI element written in code behind and replicate them in XAML.

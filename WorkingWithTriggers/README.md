This sample relates to the [Working with Triggers in Xamarin.Forms 1.3](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/triggers) doc but rewrite with prism library and all latest nuget packages at the time of writing in Feb 2018. I also added more validation logic as sample.

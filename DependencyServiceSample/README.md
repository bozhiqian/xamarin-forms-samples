Dependency Service Sample
=====================

This sample relates to the [Accessing Native Features with DependencyService](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/application-fundamentals/dependency-service/) but I rewrite with prism libary with appropriate updates to remove all code behind into view model. I removed all UI element written in code behind and replicate them in XAML.
